LIBRARY MANAGEMENT USING GO : 

The project is a Go language-based HTTP API using the GoFr framework, integrating MongoDB for data persistence. It encompasses CRUD operations for a simplified e-commerce service, managing products. The application includes a comprehensive suite of unit tests with a focus on achieving over 60% test coverage. The API supports creating, reading, updating, and deleting product entities. Real-world scenarios, such as product inventory management, guide the implementation.
